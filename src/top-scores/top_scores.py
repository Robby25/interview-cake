def fastSort( scores, highest_possible_score ):

	**********************************************************************************************************************
	You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.
	You rank players in the game from highest to lowest score. So far you're using an algorithm that sorts 
	in O(nlgn) time, but players are complaining that their rankings aren't updated fast enough. 
	You need a faster sorting algorithm.
	
	Write a function that takes:
	
	a list of unsorted_scores
	the highest_possible_score in the game
	and returns a sorted list of scores in less than O(nlgn) time.
