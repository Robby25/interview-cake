	**********************************************************************************************************************
	Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. 
	You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
	To do this, youâ€™ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. 
	In HiCal, a meeting is stored as tuples of integers (start_time, end_time). 
	These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

	Write a function condense_meeting_times() that takes an array of meeting time ranges and returns 
	an array of condensed ranges.
